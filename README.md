# Basics-Image-Processing

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs â€” and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.
The main purpose of Computer Vision is to understand images and interpret them for our purposes.

OpenCV is most commonly used in Python for Machine Learning applications, specifically in the Computer Vision domain for image processing.

To have fun with images and videos, you need to Install the library. OpenCV Python can be installed from the PyPi package.
